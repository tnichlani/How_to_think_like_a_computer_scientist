# Assign to a variable in your program a triple-quoted string that contains your favourite paragraph of text — 
perhaps a poem, a speech, instructions to bake a cake, some inspirational verses, etc.

# Write a function which removes all punctuation from the string, 
# breaks the string into a list of words, and counts the number of words in your text that contain the letter “e”. 
# Your program should print an analysis of the text like this:

# Your text contains 243 words, of which 109 (44.8%) contain an "e".
