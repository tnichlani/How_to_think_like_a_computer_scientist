# Write three functions that are the “inverses” of to_secs:

# hours_in returns the whole integer number of hours represented by a total number of seconds.
# minutes_in returns the whole integer number of left over minutes in a total number of seconds, once the hours have been taken out.
# seconds_in returns the left over seconds represented by a total number of seconds.
