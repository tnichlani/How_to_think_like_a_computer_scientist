# Write a function to_secs that converts hours, minutes and seconds to a total number of seconds. Here are some tests that should pass:

"""after converting all down to sconds will be straight forward"""

	m = 60 * m           # convert mins to seconds 
	return h + m + s     # add them all up to get total seconds 


print(to_secs(1, 55, 13), 'seconds') # = 6913 seconds
