# Write a function that helps answer questions like ‘“Today is Wednesday. 
# I leave on holiday in 19 days time. 
# What day will that be?”’ So the function must take a day name and a delta argument — the number of days to add — 
# and should return the resulting day name:


days = ['sun' , 'mon' , 'tue' , 'wed' , 'thu' , 'fri' , 'sat']

"""if given a day name and a number of days to wait, return the departure day name"""

def what_day(x, y):
	today = days.index(x) # 3
	wait_period = y # 19
	leaving_on_day_num = today + wait_period # 22
	result = leaving_on_day_num % 7 # 22 % 7
	departure_day = days[result] # monday 
	return departure_day # final result 


answer = what_day('wed' , 19)
print("You will be leaving on:" , answer.title() + 'day!')
